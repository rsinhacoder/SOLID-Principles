// Summary of Design Patterns
// Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance.

// Factory: Encapsulates object creation logic.

// Observer: Notifies dependents of state changes.

// Strategy: Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms.

// These patterns are foundational in software design and help solve common problems in a structured and reusable way. By understanding and applying them, you can write cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable code.
