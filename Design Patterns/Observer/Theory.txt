The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. It is commonly used in event handling systems.

Use Cases:
    Event-driven systems.
    Implementing publish-subscribe mechanisms.
    Updating UI components when data changes.
